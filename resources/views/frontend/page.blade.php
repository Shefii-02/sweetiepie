                        <div class="content">A. In general. <br>

                            We collect information through our Website, emails, mail, fax, telephone, mobile devices and
                            applications and social media applications (such as our Facebook App) including when you:
                            <br>

                            visit our Website and use our Service,
                            place an order,
                            participate in our forums, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, content submissions,
                            chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, and membership
                            registrations, and
                            engage in other activities, services, products and resources we make accessible to our
                            customers, members or users.
                            The information may be provided directly to us by you when placing an order or participating
                            in a survey, etc. , or, as is true of most websites, we gather certain information
                            automatically. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
                            device information, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed
                            on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or
                            clickstream data to analyze trends and administer the Website. This information may be
                            collected by us even if an order, registration, or other process is started but not
                            completed or is otherwise cancelled. <br>


                            B. How we use "Cookies" and "Action Tags." <br>

                            A "cookie" is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your
                            computer. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer, user or Member and to
                            provide certain features to you. Most web browsers allow you to instruct the browser to
                            prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the
                            Services, such as the shopping basket, may not function properly. To manage Flash cookies,
                            please click here: <br>
                            http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
                            <br>
                            We have relationships with third parties who may collect or receive information directly
                            from the cookies placed by our Service on your computer to assist in analyzing our business
                            and customers. <br>

                            Our Service may also use a common web technology called "action tags" (also called single
                            pixel gifs or web beacons) to track purchase, usage and other web activity information.
                            Action tags may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. In addition,
                            third parties may set their own cookies and tags through our Service (such as through
                            interest-based advertising, described below). We do not control such third parties or their
                            privacy practices. If you do not want third parties to be able to use such methods, you
                            should modify your browser settings to limit such access.
                            <br>

                            C. Interest-based advertising. <br>

                            Our Services. We collect data from you for use in interest-based advertising when you use
                            our Service. Other companies may serve interest-based advertisements on our Service. We
                            comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered
                            by the Digital Advertising Alliance ( aboutads.info).
                            Other Services. Advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party
                            websites around the Internet. Some websites and services deliver these advertisements based
                            upon data that has been previously collected about your past behavior online. For example,
                            if you have viewed websites about gift baskets, these websites or services may display to
                            you an advertisement for our gift baskets. This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes
                            called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. It is generally not based upon your
                            personal information (such as your name or email address), but rather, upon your online
                            activities. We do not control such third party websites or services on which these
                            advertisements appear. Further, we do not control how they collect and use data about your
                            online activities. <br>
                            Consent. You may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies who are listed
                            at www.aboutads.info/choices/ OR www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and may
                            also learn more about online behavioral advertising at such websites. If you opt-out, you
                            will still receive generic advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you by such
                            companies from whom you have opted out based upon your behavioral data possessed by the
                            companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, for each
                            browser and each device, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will
                            have to repeat this process. We do not respond to or honor "do not track" (a/k/a DNT)
                            signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
                            <br>

                            D. Push Notifications. <br>

                            As a user who has downloaded our Company’s mobile application, we may from time-to-time send
                            you push notifications to your device in order to communicate with you and advise you of
                            current offers and promotions. To ensure that you receive timely notification of such
                            communications and promotions, we need to collect certain information from your device as
                            indicated above. If at any time you do not wish to receive these types of communications,
                            you may turn them off at the device level. <br>

                            E. Mobile Analytics. <br>

                            We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our
                            Company’s mobile application on your device. This software may record information such as
                            how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, usage,
                            performance data, and the source from which the application was downloaded. We do not link
                            the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable
                            information you submit within the mobile application.

                            our products and services (such as by responding to your feedback), to conduct research
                            (such as statistics on favorite -- i.e., most ordered -- products), to provide an enhanced
                            and more personalized shopping experience (for instance, to provide event reminders, such as

                            Pie family of brands and Company Affiliates, and to enable you to receive credits for
                            purchases under loyalty or buying programs which you have joined. <br>

                            We may also use your information, as necessary or appropriate in our view, to operate the
                            Service, process orders or registrations, to conduct promotions, contests, and sweepstakes
                            you participate in. <br>

                            We may combine information we receive from you via our Service with information from our
                            Affiliates and third parties. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize

                            communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>

                            In addition, as provided below, the Company may use or share your data with both affiliated

                            controlled by, or under common control with, or in the same corporate family as, Sweetie Pie

                            institutions, credit/debit card payment processors, business partners, vendors and service
                            providers, but we generally only authorize them to use such information for our benefit, for
                            instance, to process your order and to better communicate and provide appropriate offers to
                            you and your gift recipient. <br>

                            available to selected third parties including, but not limited to, those who share or rent

                            We may use your information to match it with other public and private data sources (such as

                            other promotional services, for example, to enhance one or both of our advertising or
                            promotional endeavors.

                            We appreciate your patience with shipping delays. Due to increased order volume and the
                            impact of COVID-19, it may take longer for your order to arrive. Your order may also arrive
                            a day early due to the availability of delivery services, and there select hours. We also
                            have advised our delivery drivers to leave the packages at the front door, without making
                            physical contact with the recipients.

                            We are now offering a touchless delivery confirmation continuing to try and protect the
                            spread of COVID19. Our driver will confirm delivery once its at the door and it will notify
                            the recipient and the customer immediately.

                            Due to the perishable nature of our products and the security policies of many military
                            installations, we are unable to deliver to military installations.

                        <div class="content">


                            If the recipient is not available at the delivery address specified we will typically leave
                            the order with a neighbour or, if possible, in a safe place at the delivery address.
                            Alternatively, we may attempt re-delivery later in the day. If this is not feasible or the
                            recipient is unavailable when a later delivery is attempted we will leave a calling card on
                            their door explaining what has happened. This card will provide the recipient with our
                            contact information so they can call us and arrange for collection or re-delivery of their
                            gift. Due to the fresh nature of our products, we cannot be held responsible for failed
                            delivery attempts because your intended recipient is unavailable. After 24 hours of failed
                            delivery attempts and/or lack of contact from the intended recipient items will be returned
                            to the respective shipping location and you will be notified.
